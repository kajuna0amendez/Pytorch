# Mulitlayer Perceptron

A series of multilayer perceptron implementations

1. MultiLayerPerceptron.py testing of the performance on cpu and gpu

2. MultiLayerPerceptronOpt.py hacking into the optim to use the backpropagation equations using the grad vector

3. Adding the normalization layer from "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift"

Additionally:

A series of papers and my class on multilayer perceptron
